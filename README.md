Flipkart Sales Database Project
This project contains a relational database schema designed to simulate Flipkart’s sales operations. It includes Customers, Products, Sales, Payments, and Shipping tables, providing a realistic dataset for learning, analysis, and reporting.
With this database, you can:
Track customer purchases and behavior
Analyze product sales and revenue trends
Monitor payment statuses and order fulfillment 
Evaluate shipping performance and delivery efficiency
The schema is ideal for SQL practice, data analytics projects, and building dashboards for e-commerce insights.
